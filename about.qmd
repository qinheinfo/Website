Based in Toronto, I am enthusiastic about technology and anything cute. 

**Designer**
As a UX designer with a background in graphic design, I've earned recognition, including the nomination award in the 8th China Illustration Biennial and the Hiiibrand Illustration Award over the past two years. My stint as a Creative Design Intern at @PayPal has broadened my perspective on commercializing graphic design. Guided by mentors and seniors, I transitioned to the field of UX design, where my passion continues to grow.

**Thinker**
I'm not just a designer with a problem-solving mindset and graphic skills; I also focus on the underlying reasons and product strategy. My dedication lies in achieving a delicate balance between stakeholders' interests, effective product positioning, and delivering an exceptional user experience.
 
**Infinite learner**
In addition to my focus on design, I am also curious about diverse realms of knowledge. Recognizing that design is intricately connected to data-driven decision-making, I am currently enrolled in data science and data analysis programs on Coursera and DataCamp.

Eager to connect with people from different countries, I possess fluency in both English and Mandarin, complemented by proficiency in Japanese at an N2 level.
