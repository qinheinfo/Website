My stint as a Creative Design Intern at @PayPal has broadened my perspective on commercializing graphic design. Guided by mentors and seniors, I transitioned to the field of UX design, where my passion continues to grow.\nThinker I’m not just a designer with a problem-solving mindset and graphic skills; I also focus on the underlying reasons and product strategy. My dedication lies in achieving a delicate balance between stakeholders’ interests, effective product positioning, and delivering an exceptional user experience.\nInfinite learner In addition to my focus on design, I am also curious about diverse realms of knowledge. Recognizing that design is intricately connected to data-driven decision-making, I am currently enrolled in data science and data analysis programs on Coursera and DataCamp.\nEager to connect with people from different countries, I possess fluency in both English and Mandarin, complemented by proficiency in Japanese at an N2 level."
